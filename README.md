# What's this?

Web app that emits Modern Horizons "pack one, pick one" ratings based on card titles.

Accepts shorthand card names, one per line. You can omit spaces or apostrophes.

This is useful for quickly rating cards in a pack during a draft, or for testing your knowledge of Frank Karsten's pick order.

Example:
```
alisman of creat
santusk
man-o-war
```

Yields the cards
```
Talisman of Creativity - 3.38

Man-o'-War - 3.35

Krosan Tusker - 3.16
```
